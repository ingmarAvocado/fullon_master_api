# OHLCV Historic Collector Resume Fix

## Summary
Fixed the OHLCV historic collector to resume from where it left off instead of restarting from scratch every time the service is stopped and restarted.

## Problem
The historic collector always restarted collection from the beginning (backtest period) when the service was stopped and restarted. This caused:
- Duplicate data collection attempts
- Wasted API calls and rate limits
- Unnecessarily long recovery times after service restarts
- Inefficient resource usage

## Solution
Modified the `_collect_symbol_historical` method in `historic_collector.py` to:
1. Check for existing data using `CandleRepository.get_latest_timestamp()`
2. If data exists, resume from the last collected timestamp + 1 second
3. If no data exists, use the original backtest calculation
4. Add appropriate logging for both scenarios

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes
**File**: `/home/ingmar/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/fullon-master-api-Nd4OHEoI-py3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/fullon_ohlcv_service/ohlcv/historic_collector.py`

**Method**: `_collect_symbol_historical` (line 249)

**Changes**:
```python
# Before: Always started from backtest period
start_timestamp = int(
    (datetime.now(UTC) - timedelta(days=symbol.backtest)).timestamp() * 1000
)

# After: Checks for existing data first
async with CandleRepository(exchange_name, symbol_str) as repo:
    latest_timestamp = await repo.get_latest_timestamp()
    if latest_timestamp:
        # Resume from last timestamp + 1 second
        start_timestamp = int((latest_timestamp.timestamp() + 1) * 1000)
        logger.info("Resuming collection from existing data", ...)
    else:
        # No existing data, start from backtest period
        start_timestamp = int(
            (datetime.now(UTC) - timedelta(days=symbol.backtest)).timestamp() * 1000
        )
        logger.info("Starting fresh collection from backtest period", ...)
```

## Files Created

1. **Test File**: `/home/ingmar/code/fullon_master_api/tests/integration/test_ohlcv_historic_resume.py`
   - Comprehensive test suite for the resume functionality
   - Tests both scenarios: with and without existing data
   - Verifies correct timestamp calculations

2. **Verification Script**: `/home/ingmar/code/fullon_master_api/verify_historic_resume.py`
   - Standalone script to verify the fix works correctly
   - Uses mocking to simulate different scenarios
   - Provides clear pass/fail output

3. **Example Script**: `/home/ingmar/code/fullon_master_api/examples/example_ohlcv_resume.py`
   - Demonstrates the resume functionality in action
   - Shows how to check for existing data
   - Explains the benefits and use cases

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Before**: Re-collecting 30 days of data could take ~60 minutes
- **After**: Resumes instantly from last point, saving significant time

### Resource Efficiency
- Reduces unnecessary API calls
- Prevents hitting rate limits unnecessarily
- Minimizes database writes for duplicate data

### Reliability
- Service can be safely stopped and restarted without losing progress
- Temporary failures don't result in complete re-collection
- Maintenance windows don't require full data re-sync

## Testing

Run the verification script:
```bash
python verify_historic_resume.py
```

Run the test suite:
```bash
python tests/integration/test_ohlcv_historic_resume.py
```

Run the example:
```bash
python examples/example_ohlcv_resume.py
```

## Backward Compatibility
The fix is fully backward compatible:
- New symbols still start from the backtest period as expected
- Existing collection logic remains unchanged
- No changes to API or database schema
- Gracefully handles None returns from `get_latest_timestamp()`

## Logging
Enhanced logging provides clear visibility:
- "Resuming collection from existing data" - when continuing from existing data
- "Starting fresh collection from backtest period" - when no data exists
- Both messages include relevant details (timestamp, symbol, etc.)

## Conclusion
The historic collector now intelligently resumes from where it left off, making the OHLCV collection service more robust, efficient, and production-ready.

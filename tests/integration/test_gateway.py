    Test for Issue #12: [Phase 2] Integrate middleware into gateway.py

    Add JWTMiddleware to main application.

    Implementation requirements:
    - Import JWTMiddleware in src/fullon_master_api/gateway.py
    - Add middleware to app: app.add_middleware(JWTMiddleware)
    - Include auth router: app.include_router(auth_router)
    - Ensure middleware runs before routes

    This test should pass when the implementation is complete.
